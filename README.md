# POC ecommerce using NodeJs, Koa and SnipCart

This POC is based on (NOT forked from) :

```sh
https://github.com/snipcart/node-js-ecommerce-koajs
```

If you wish to use it, fork original project instead. This will have code and workflow explanations for a POC, but the original code base should be what you want to use for production.

to run, use the usual :

- npm init
- npm install
- npm run dev
